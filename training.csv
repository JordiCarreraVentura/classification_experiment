negative,"Hi Mowe,I do have a few questions. I understand that in Islam, you must believe in all that is taught by the prophet and cannot disagree lest you are no longer a Muslim. Is that correct?1 - If so, how do you feel about the duty of the husband to discipline his wife via physical beatings?2 - How do you feel about the doctrine that explains it is ok for a man to have several wives and for the marriage of little girls of 9 and 10 years to middle aged men? (a few weeks back a Judge refused to annul a marriage in Saudi Arabia when the mother pleaded for her 10 year old girl who was married off to the fathers' 47 year old friend as repayment for a debt)3 - How do you feel about the fact that your testimony is worth half that of a man's?4 - How do you feel about Muhammad's doctrine that allows for temporary marriages in order to allow his soldiers to have sex with women and then leave them with no rights after the temporary marriage is over (mind you this still goes on in certain Muslim countries).These are just a few examples of what I view as unreasonable demands of Islam.I can't answer your question as to why people convert to Islam - people convert to Scientology as well even though so many consider it a dangerous cult.I have however heard too many stories of those who left Islam, especially women and their stories of abuse and subjugation are horrific."

negative,"This story isn't about marijuana. Even if its legalized SWAT teams will continue to execute no-knock warrants when going after cocaine, ecstasy, heroin, meth, pcp, etc. and continue to abuse their power and authority the way they did here. If that box had contained a kilo of cocaine and the owner of the house wasn't the mayor of the town but just some random citizen unlucky enough to have their address picked by the drug dealers as a drop then you'd probably never hear this story. The cops would just lie like they apparently did both in getting the warrant (it wasn't a no-knock warrant) and trying to cover up after the fact (claiming the man opened the door then slammed it in the cops face, that the dogs were threatening the cops, etc).Legalizing marijuana won't stop this abuse by the police. It'll just remove one of the many reasons they have to abuse their power."

CIA? don't think so. The rabbit hole goes much deeper than 1 single film could ever be capable of. Missing Links highlights several culprits behind the curtain hidden safely in shadows of this fraud of the century. PNAC is the cornerstone to 9/11. Just ask Sibel Edmonds Ashcroft invoked the 'state secrets' privilege on her to silence her completely and prevent her from revealing the truth of their crime networks and weapons/arms trading profiteer deals. They are afraid of her speaking in a court of law, under oath, of what she knows of this cover-up. What have they got to hide? Why such intense secrecy. Is this how an innocent party acts? 9/11 is a trans-national scandal that would embarrass far too many 'important' people.Any wonder why this PNAC 'think tank' group and their 'new Pearl Harbor' to put our major-theater war manifesto in motion- 'coincidence' was never investigated, questioned, held to account, probed, much less mentioned or analyzed in the slightest by the usual paid-for talking pundits on controlled fake 'news' networks to speak of.."

The sentence you're responding to ('chemically enhanced pitches') was a figure of speech -- PEDs help pitchers reduce fatigue as the season wears on, thus making them more effective in the later months than they otherwise would be. Example: Ryan Franklin 2003. He had a career year where he was able to throw 200+ innings of quality pitching despite *zero* enhancement to his 'stuff,' was busted in 2004, and has since found starting significantly more difficult and has been relegated to a relief role.2) Velocity induces *vastly* more swinging strikes than it does turning ordinary flyballs into home runs.

I suggest you actually read the text of those couple of lines that DeMint was questioning, in context with the entire section of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.Priority funding is given to higher education facilities that have been included in a declared emergency. All the funds are administered through the state departments of higher education, and distributed in proportion to the number of students at each school.  All schools receiving grants have to commit to spending 25 percent of the grant to projects that are certifiable under 'green' building standards, such as the LEED Green Building system, etc. The grants are to be used for a wide variety of renovations and improvements '...that are primarily used for instruction, research, or student housing....'EXCEPT   (A) the maintenance of systems, equipment, or facilities, including maintenance associated with any permissible uses of funds described in paragraph (1);   (B) modernization, renovation, or repair of stadiums or other facilities primarily used for athletic contests or exhibitions or other events for which admission is charged to the general public;   (C) modernization, renovation, or repair of facilities--      (i) used for sectarian instruction, religious worship, or a school or department of divinity; or      (ii) in which a substantial portion of the functions of the facilities are subsumed in a religious mission; or   (D) construction of new facilities.So, while the money can be used for projects in facilities that are primarily used for instruction...if the facility is primarily used for instruction in religion (such as a school of divinity), then the grant money cannot be used to renovate or improve that facility. At least 25 percent of the grant money has to be spent on green building projects.I'm not certain if that bit in the bill is discriminatory, though it seems likely, as the wording is vague (how much usage is 'substantial'?); the government withholds money that would be granted for improvements to facilities used for any other type of instruction. Not exactly equal treatment under the eyes of the lawmakers. DeMint appears to have been grandstanding with his proposed amendment:'To allow the free exercise of religion at institutions of higher education that receive funding under section 803 of division A'That said, I think the entire bill is a travesty, as you don't get out of debt by digging ever deeper into your creditor's pockets.

I intend to continue to read about his decisions and if they do not show a clear direction toward restoration of our civil liberties very soon I am likely to be marching in the streets with the 'radicals.'And after reading the testimony of Spc.

The storeowner has to spend money, but if not for the broken window he could have spent that money on something else.Does Media Matters believe the government should pay people to dig holes and then fill them in? Imagine how many people THAT would put to work? Of course, that's silly. But in the same way, we believe, and Fox News explains, that spending on useless projects is NOT stimulative.Government spending projects didn't work in the 30s. Didn't work in Japan in the 90s.

How are you going to remember the address of your home computer for example.

I realize that dollars/pounds/yen are just pieces of paper whose values can be bubbles or (like the American dollar probably soon will) rapidly devalue.Gold/silver are like currency in many ways though. They do have the advantage that, since it is difficult to print gold the market isn't likely to get flooded with gold - but many minerals and stones share this characteristic.What makes gold so special? It's all in our heads - just like every other bubble. Land is even more difficult to print than gold. It grows more scarce with increases in population. Houses often come with land and represent a significant amount of labor. If one owns a home with a value of 'x' they will enjoy far more benifits than a person who owns a sum of gold with an equal value. The housing bubble was dumb but not as dumb as the gold bubble. I'm not saying buying gold is necessarily stupid - you can get very rich off of bubbles as many did with housing - just be aware that they pop.Also wealth is destroyed. Depreciation, vandalism, consumption (eg. food), and reduction in number of services provided all destroy wealth. I believe what you are getting at is that wealth doesn't instantly evaporate unless ICBMs are launched. It is important to be aware that these factors do erase wealth because as a recession or depression wears on they will force some gold owners to cash in their investment to replace other assets. This will cause gold to start consistently losing value. This will cause a loss of confidence in the bubble - then it will pop."

I dunno.In a drug bust, the property of the one busted, or unclaimed property found at the site, or even the land itself, can be forfeit. It depends on a million things, but the basics are if there's a criminal conviction in drugs, then it opens up the money game. This may only be with felonies, which may go toward Ms. Krause's words about the sheriff expecting 500 plants instead of her 24.Anyway, assuming many things:* Bust somebody and later there's a conviction* The county then sues the (new) felon in civil court using the criminal conviction as evidence* Based on that evidence, the county gets the land, the car found there, etc.It's very big money. While drug cases have special provisions to make it easier for the government to get the goods, it can also apply to other crimes. Such as if somebody robs a bank, the county can sue to get the car that was used in the crime. Otherwise, the car would (should) be returned after the case is over, even if the person is convicted.For drug cases, many times law enforcement is able to find a boatload of cash. Not for Ms Krause's 24 plants, but if they find a briefcase full of money, the county sues, gets the cash, and then they buy more ambulances, firetrucks, police cars, oak desks for the city counsel, etc."

Since it will be an uniform software platform, there will be no need to compile locally in any way. This has worked for ages on CE devices such as the GP2x, Nokia 770/N800/N810, Pandora, Android, LiMo phones, etc.Just because you can compile if you want doesn't mean you have to. Case in point: you CAN compile Firefox on your Windows PC. How many people actually do that?"

negative,"See fungie5's response for some of the reason they don't do this. Basically the shuttle parachute works because it only has to safely slow the plane from a pretty slow speed that is just above the minimum speed the shuttle can 'fly' at. It only has to work in one orientation to the horizon (horizontal nose forward). And the shuttle frame is built like a mac truck compared to an airplane that is built like a bird. There is only one place the frame of an airplane could possibly withstand the forces generated by a parachute deployment, and that is at the root of the wings on the spar. Not an ideal placement for a parachute."
negative,"It's one thing to copy minor or common features not available for Macintosh browsers. I'm fine with that.The problem is when Apple rips off a feature and pretends they are the ones who thought of it in the first place. On the feature list, they claim they are the first browser to pass Acid3 compliance. No, they are using the Webkit engine which passed on the same day that Opera's engine passed as well. They say they are the first browser able to integrate with RSS feeds. Actually, Opera and Firefox both have been utilizing RSS technology long before Safari implemented that feature.Those are only several examples of their hubris but there's about a dozen more of these white lies spread throughout their marketing. I'm ok with feature copying as a form of flattery, but Apple has a bad habit of misrepresenting the facts to make it look like they were the innnovators when in actuality they are just pissing on the shoulders of giants."

negative,"What part doesn't make sense? I do have some microbiology classes under my belt do you?Bacteria of all sorts are not good for you in certain doses. Good bacteria can run a muck and cause disease too. We call them good bacteria because they are naturally part of the fauna of our bodies and in normal numbers they contributes to our health. When their numbers are too great they cause disease. Whole milk spoils as well.Outside of the environment they are acclimatized to (adapted to) the bovine body those bacteria will likely not do as well giving room for other bacteria to grow. Many bacteria will be introduced at all levels of industrial handling and if those bacteria grow faster than the natural bovine fauna then you get dangerous whole milk. Part of the reason why pasteurization was mandated int he first place was the rampant cases of food poisoning due to bacteria introduced into the milk and which did better than the ones already in the milk.Think of yeast infections. Yeast is a natural part of the fauna of human female genitalia but when there is a sudden shift in numbers or a PH shift which kills the yeast you can get an infection of either an over abundance of natural yeast or different strains of yeast."

They have worked in cahoots with the analyst firms and even financial journalists to destroy public companies for gain. Since the removal of the uptick rule in 2007, short sellers have run rampant in the market. They took down a perfectly healthy Bear Stearns in a couple of days, for example, which would have been impossible with the uptick rule in place.

negative,"'Congress needs to craft innovative legislation that makes health care more affordable without raising taxes or increasing the deficit. It also needs to repeal bad laws that keep health care costs higher than necessary. ' 'We should remember that HMOs did not arise because of free-market demand, but rather because of government mandates. The HMO Act of 1973 requires all but the smallest employers to offer their employees HMO coverage, and the tax code allows businesses – but not individuals – to deduct the cost of health insurance premiums. The result is the illogical coupling of employment and health insurance, which often leaves the unemployed without needed catastrophic coverage.' 'While many in Congress are happy to criticize HMOs today, the public never hears how the present system was imposed upon the American people by federal law. As usual, government intervention in the private market failed to deliver the promised benefits and caused unintended consequences, but Congress never blames itself for the problems created by bad laws. Instead, we are told more government – in the form of “universal coverage” – is the answer. But government already is involved in roughly two-thirds of all health care spending, through Medicare, Medicaid, and other programs. ' 'The following are bills Congress should pass to reduce health care costs and leave more money in the pockets of families: '"
